# Easy_UVM_Examples
Examples to apply UVM to existing test benches at ease.  
You can learn how UVM is applied to your conventional module based testbenches in a step by step manner.

+ TB0.5 : UVM message printing application<BR>
+ TB1   : Usage of UVM test class inside the testbench module. Test start and finish by the UVM test class with report summary printing<BR>
+ TB2   : DUT configuration from the UVM test class<BR>
+ TB3   : Start a test sequence task from the UVM test class<BR>
+ TB4   : Add another (random) UVM test<BR>
