# Easy_UVM_Examples
Examples to apply UVM to existing test benches at ease.
You can learn how UVM is applied to your conventional module based testbenches in step by step manner.

TB0   : Original module based testbench
TB0.5 : UVM message printing application
TB1   : Define UVM test class inside the testbench module. Test start and finish by the UVM test class with report summary printing.
TB2   : DUT configuration from the UVM test class
TB3   : Start a test sequence task from the UVM test class
TB4   : Add another (random) UVM test
TB5   : Start DUT checker from the UVM test class
TB6   : Drive existing Bus Functional Model from the UVM test class via interface
TB7   : Split test classes into a package
TB8   : Move a drive task and a check task into the UVM test class from modules.
TB9   : Split the drive/check task into UVM driver/monitor component classes.
TB10  : Split the UVM driver/monitor components into dedicated packages.
